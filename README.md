# google-home-clone
Home assistant clone is a school project that aims to replicate few of the basic features of modern-day home assistants. It gives voice control over distant leds (on/off), distant gates (open/close), and reading home temperature, and uses Python, Arduino, and a bunch of ESP8266 microchips to achieve that.
